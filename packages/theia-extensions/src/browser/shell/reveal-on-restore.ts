/**
 * Registry of views that must be revealed on every launch, even when Theia
 * restores a previously-saved shell layout.
 *
 * Why this exists: in Electron, Theia's shell-layout cache (`localStorage`
 * key `theia:layout`) is not scoped per workspace — `LocalStorageService.prefix()`
 * returns the bare key for Electron, so every workspace on a machine shares one
 * cached layout. `AbstractViewContribution.initializeLayout()` (the mechanism
 * that normally opens a view by default) only runs when no layout is cached at
 * all, so a view added to the defaults *after* a user's first-ever SPEXR launch
 * never appears for them again, in any workspace, until they toggle it manually
 * or clear the cache. Any view bound here is force-revealed on every restore to
 * route around that gap — see docs/memory/spexr-multiwindow-limitation.md.
 *
 * To keep a view visible across future default-layout changes, bind it here
 * instead of special-casing `SpexrShellLayoutContribution`:
 *   bind(SpexrRevealOnRestore).toService(SomeViewContribution);
 * `SomeViewContribution` must already exist as a singleton binding (e.g. via
 * `bindViewContribution`) — `toService` aliases it, it does not construct a
 * second instance.
